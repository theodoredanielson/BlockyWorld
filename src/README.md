Notes to Grader:
- Earlier steps of the assignment are commented out but preserved to show progression.
- Collaboration: I worked with Sam Morrow. We would discuss videos and follow them along together.
- Used ChatGPT to clarify concepts related to sphere creation.
- GitHub Copilot occasionally auto-completed parts of this file, but those suggestions were revised as needed.
- Had ChatGPT format and add comments to some of my code, but that sometimes resulted in broken codeâ€”so I had to fix those manually.
- I implemented a cockroach using hierarchical transformations and multiple cubes.
- Non-cube primitive: SPHERE
- poke() kills the cockroach, triggering a special animation sequence.
- Sliders allow control over joint angles for realistic movement.
- Animation is implemented for leg movement, and a toggle button allows turning it on and off.
- Mouse control enables interactive rotation of the cockroach.
- Performance optimization ensures at least 10 FPS with an on-screen FPS counter.
