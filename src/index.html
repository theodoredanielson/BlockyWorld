 Notes to Grader:
  - Not entirely sure how we're supposed to proved that
    we were able to achieve the earlier steps (like the
    blue square), so I've left that code in and just
    commented it out.
  - I worked with two friends on steps 1-3 of the assignment.
    That "working with" was mostly just settup and searching
    the textbook for the correct files we were meant to download.
         > Friends/collaborators:
            - Sam Morrow
            - Taima Traore
  - Used ChatGPT for help with cross function. Wasn't entirely sure
    what "cross" meant in this context, but it made it clear it was 
    for the cross product of two vectors, which would then be used 
    for the area.
  - Some half-written lines were completed by VS Code/GitHub Copilot's
    auto-complete feature. This would, more often than not, result in 
    non-functioning code, so personal revision would be necessary.
